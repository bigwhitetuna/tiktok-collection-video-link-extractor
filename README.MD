# TikTok Video Link Extractor

A lightweight, privacy-respecting Firefox extension that extracts video links from TikTok collection pages and downloads them as a JSON file.

Intended to work with [TikTok Recipe Builder](https://github.com/bigwhitetuna/TikTok-Recipe-Builder) as it is completed.

## Features

- Extracts all video links from the current TikTok collection page
- Automatically downloads the links as `tiktok_links.json`
- Smart toast notifications for status updates
- Detects when you're not on TikTok and disables the UI accordingly
- Runs entirely client-side â€” no tracking, no network requests

## How to Use

1. Go to a TikTok collection or profile video grid.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to ensure all videos are loaded.
3. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
4. Click the "Download TikTok Links" button.
5. A `tiktok_links.json` file will be downloaded with all video URLs.
